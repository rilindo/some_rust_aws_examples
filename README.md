# Some examples of using RUST with AWS.

I am getting started with [Rust with Rusoto](https://www.rusoto.org/) and I found it frustrating to use - unlike other languages like [Python](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) and [Ruby](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/), Rust doesn't have very clear examples for Rust beginners like me to use AWS. So I am putting some of what I have on hand out here and hopefully populate it with some other examples so that other people won't have the same experience of trying to use Rust with AWS.

# Note to Vistor

I am still new to Rust, so there will be a lot of newbie code. Expect lots of refactoring.

(If you have your own examples or wish to improve on what I wrote, please feel free to contribute).
