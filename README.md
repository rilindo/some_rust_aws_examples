Some examples of using RUST with AWS. I am getting started with Rust and I found it frustrating to not to find some simple examples of using the rust with AWS. So I putting this out there and hopefully populate it with some other examples so that this can help other people get started.

(If you have your own examples, please free free to contribute)
