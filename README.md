# Some examples of using RUST with AWS.

I am getting started with [Rust with Rusoto](https://www.rusoto.org/) and I found it frustrating to use - unlike other languages like [Python](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) and [Ruby](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/), Rust doesn't have very clear examples for Rust beginners like me to use AWS. So I am putting some of what I have on hand out here and hopefully populate it with some other examples so that other people won't have the same experience of trying to use Rust with AWS.

(If you have your own examples, please free free to contribute)
